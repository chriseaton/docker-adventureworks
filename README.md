Now you can quickly spin up the *AdventureWorks* sample database in **docker**!

This database is great for testing database features and experimenting in database administration as it comes preloaded with a reasonable (example) enterprise database architecture and records! Samples include fictitious employees, departments, addresses, payroll, contacts, sales, products, and so much more!

These databases are built off the available backups provided by Microsoft, and a custom port to *postgres*.
The docker images utilize the native images provided for *AdventureWorks* on **Postgres** and **Microsoft SQL Server**.

This project is available on...
- Docker Hub: [`chriseaton/adventureworks`](https://hub.docker.com/r/chriseaton/adventureworks)
- GitHub: [`chriseaton/docker-adventureworks`](https://github.com/chriseaton/docker-adventureworks)

To run one of the samples, see Â§Running below.    
You can find samples of a `docker` or `docker-compose.yaml` files in the `samples/` directory.

## Quick Start

To get started, you just need to fire off one of the `docker` commands below (modify as desired) which will pull and run the database image.

Check out the `samples/` directory for more (such as a `docker compose` file).

> [!TIP]
> Replace `My_password1` with your own secure password. Note that the password *must* pass minimum complexity requirements
or you won't be able to connect!

### Microsoft SQL Server
This docker image is extended from the official [Microsoft SQL Server docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-mssql-server) image and so you can use the same environmental variables defined on there.
```
docker run -p 1433:1433 \
 -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' \
 -e 'MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=My_password1' \
 -d chriseaton/adventureworks:latest
```

### Postgres
This docker image is extended from the official [Postgres docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) image and so you can use the same environmental variables defined on there.
```
docker run -p 5432:5432 \
 -e 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD=My_password1' \
 -d chriseaton/adventureworks:postgres
```

## Tags
Currently this docker image is available in two supported database engines: Microsoft SQL Server & Postgres

To ensure parity and cross-compatibility, we use a slightly older version of each.

- Microsoft SQL 2022 & 2017
- Postgres 16 & 13

> [!NOTE]
> ARM/i386 support is currently only available on the Postgres 16 images and later.    

If you'd like to leverage a specific version, you can clone this repository and modify the `build.sh` scripts in the 
appropriate folder.

### Microsoft SQL Server
There are three versions tagged for Microsoft SQL Server:

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `latest` or `oltp` or `oltp-2022` | This image contains the standard OLTP version of the AdventureWorks database on Microsoft SQL 2022. |
| `oltp-2017` | This image contains the standard OLTP version of the AdventureWorks database on Microsoft SQL 2017. |
| `datawarehouse` or `datawarehouse-2022` | This image utilizes the data warehouse version of the AdventureWorks database on Microsoft SQL 2022. |
| `datawarehouse-2017` | This image utilizes the data warehouse version of the AdventureWorks database on Microsoft SQL 2017. |
| `light` or `light-2022` | This image utilizes the "light" version of the AdventureWorks database on Microsoft SQL 2022. |
| `light-2017` | This image utilizes the "light" version of the AdventureWorks database on Microsoft SQL 2017. |

> [!NOTE]
>  The original AdventureWorks database by Microsoft was released under MIT license:
> https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/blob/master/license.txt

### Postgres
At this time, only the tables and data are fully implemented but should be accurately converted to postgres data types (including geography).
Some views (specifically, the ones using XML and `CROSS APPLY`) have been omitted.

No functions, custom types, or stored procedures are included.

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `postgres` or `postgres-16` | This image adapts the "light" version of the AdventureWorks database to Postgres 16.  |
| `postgres-13` | This image adapts the "light" version of the AdventureWorks database to Postgres 13.  |

## Development

### Building
Run the `build.sh` script to download the AdventureWorks [backup file from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure), and to build and tag the docker image.

For multi-architecture build support see the [docker documentation here](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/#cross-compilation).

In a nutshell on your linux machine, run:
```sh
docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
```
...and in your `/etc/docker/daemon.json` configuration file, add:
```
{
    "features": {
        "containerd-snapshotter": true
    }
}
```
...once these things are done you should be able to run a multi-platform build, like [in this example](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/#simple-multi-platform-build-using-emulation).

### Publishing
If you are a maintainer, you can publish the image to docker hub [chriseaton/adventureworks](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/chriseaton/adventureworks).

```sh
docker push chriseaton/adventureworks
```
